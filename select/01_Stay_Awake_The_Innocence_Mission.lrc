[00:31.66] Stay awake, don't rest your head
[00:42.47] Don't lie down upon your bed
[00:52.47] While the moon drifts in the skies
[01:03.23] Stay awake, don't close your eyes
[01:19.73] 
[01:25.80] Though the world is fast asleep
[01:35.83] Though your pillow's soft and deep
[01:46.60] You're not sleepy as you seem
[01:57.52] Stay awake, don't nod and dream
[02:08.33] Stay awake, don't nod and dream
