Your life
Is like free to fly,
If feeling it is wrong
I don't ever want to feel it right.
It could almost be so,
It is sure to be so
Sensational.
My prayer
Is seldom heard
Ease into my arms
And whisper liquid words of love.
It could give you everything
That you want it to,
If you want it to.
If only you would jump on board,
Ride the train of thought,
Wish the world awake.
If only you could break the line,
You could learn this time and
Wish the world awake.
I close my eyes.
(Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up,
Wish the world awake)
(Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up,
Wish the world awake)
She gave
And gave of herself
'Til there was nothing left
And got down on her knees and prayed.
Prayed for an angel to fill her empty soul,
Do angels come so big?
I don't think so.
If only you would jump on board,
Ride the train of thought,
Wish the world awake.
If only you could break the line,
If only you could learn this time,
Wish the world awake.
(If only you would jump on board)
Ride the train of thought,
Wish the world awake.
(If only you could break the line)
If only you could learn this time,
We could wish the world awake.
