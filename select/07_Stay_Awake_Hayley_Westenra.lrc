[00:18.97] Stay awake, don't rest your head
[00:26.15] Don't lie down upon your bed
[00:35.10] While the moon drifts in the skies
[00:46.03] Stay awake, don't close your eyes
[01:02.53] 
[00:58.64] Though the world is fast asleep
[01:06.76] Though your pillow's soft and deep
[01:13.99] You're not sleepy as you seem
[01:24.88] Stay awake, don't nod and dream
[01:37.40] Stay awake, don't nod and dream
